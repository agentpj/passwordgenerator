![The webpage includes a box that has a button to generate a password.  Once clicked, a series of prompts will be required from the user in order to determine length of password, type of characters to be included in the password.  See image of the deployed site.](./assets/03-javascript-homework-demo.png)

The purpose of this program is to generate a random password for the user.
The user will need to provide the desired length of the password with a minimum of 8 up to 128 characters.  If the length entered is not within these parameters, the user will be asked to try again.
The user will need to specify what characters will be included in the password by a series of prompts or password criteria.  The user will be asked if they want lower case alphabet, upper case alphabet, integers or special characters in the new password.
The user will need to choose at least one criteria in order to generate a password.  If the user does not select a criteria, they will need to try again.
Once a valid password length and at least one criteria is entered, the program will generate a password within the user's criteria.
The password will be displayed within the box above the red button.
The user has the ability to re-generate a new password if they choose to.
